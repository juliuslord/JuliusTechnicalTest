You'll need to do at least what I've done to succeed, but I'd recommend checking out their GlassDoor page first.

Your task is to create a modular building system out of primitive shapes in a game engine of your choice. (Unity, Unreal etc). For this we expect as a minimum: 
- To be able to run your build on windows. 
- Be able to select a 3D shape and place it into an environment. 
- Be able to edit, configure and move the placed objects and shapes. 
- Be able to delete/remove placed objects and shapes from the environment. 
We encourage you to show us your skills during this task, the above points are a minimum, so please add any extra functionality that you want to the application. 
Deliverables: - Link to your project on GitHub or equivalent. - A zipped release of your project. - Video demo. You have 48 hours to complete this task and submit your results
